# fabric_helper

Enhance Daniel Miessler's Fabric to be able to easily write new patterns.

Use LLMs to analyze the structure and content of existing patterns to write new patterns.

Example usage:

`fabric_helper 'you are an expert in producing organized nested bulleted hierarchy outlines of input documents'`

* Automatically titles the pattern and places it in your patterns folder (for example, on linux that's `~/.config/fabric/patterns/my_new_pattern/system.md`) with an appropriate name befitting the new pattern.

See https://github.com/violet4/fabric_helper/issues/1 for an example of what we're trying to do.
