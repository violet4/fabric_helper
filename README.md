# fabric_helper

Enhance Daniel Miessler's Fabric to be able to easily write new patterns.

Use LLMs to analyze the structure and content of existing patterns to write new patterns.

Example usage:

`fabric_helper 'please make a new pattern which can be used to help me organize and outline information. it needs to be especially skilled with markdown format, particularly nested bullet/numbered lists. i should be able to feed it an essay and ask it to generate a well structured bullet-point-format outline.'`
